\section{Conclusion}

The main results showed, that there are no severe differences in performance between the two versions MIKE \#3 and MIKE \#6, despite the new electronics. There are some points in which MIKE \#6 shows a weaker performance, for example maximum acceleration, maximum torque or the force generation in the virtual wall rendering. This was to be expected due to the new electronics. However, the performance is enough for its application. The device is not used at its torque or acceleration limits. The force generation (virtual wall) is smaller for MIKE \#6, but the generation of MIKE \#3 is also not sufficient to render a wall, this is why we use the hard-stop for the force test.

All of the scripts to measure and analyse the data have been written in a way, that allows for future usage. Therefore, also other devices can be evaluated.
