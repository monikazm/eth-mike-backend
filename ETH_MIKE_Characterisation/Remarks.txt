The file MAIN_static_friction.vi can be used to obtain static friction for both CW and CCW movement.
For CW, select "Current Direction" as positive and start at the very left end of the angular range (i.e. -90 deg).
For CCW, select "Current Direction" as negative but start at -85 deg AND NOT -90 deg because otherwise the wall is hit.
This is not a bit issue: put endeffector such that it is at zero position and upload labview script. Don't press "move"
but manually move the endeffector such that it is at -85 deg. Then re-upload the script again. No the starting position 0 deg
is set at -85 deg on the physical scale and you can start by pressing "move".
