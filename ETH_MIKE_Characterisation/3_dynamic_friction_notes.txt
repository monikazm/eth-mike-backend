To do with the code: 
1. Saving data (TDMS) 
2. Shorter waiting time until I start the ramp - done 
3. Reset time to zero after each iteration - don't bother with that 
4. Only time as a indicator (other things were for troubleshooting)
5. Later if time - add calibration (it is more neccessary in case of static friction measurement)
